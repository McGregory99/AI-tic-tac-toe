# AI-tic-tac-toe
Practical exercise of the course "CS50 Introduction to AI". In it, it was requested to develop all the logic of the program to generate a tic tac toe adversary based on Artificial Intelligence. For this I have used the MiniMax algorithm

**runner.py** -> From this file the interface is launched and the program is initialized

**tictactoe.py** -> This file has the "back-end" logic
